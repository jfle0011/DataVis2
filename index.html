            <h1>CO2 Emissions - Consequences and Causes</h1>
            <p>Our world has began to experience the a vast number 
                <br>climate disasters such more extreme heat waves, 
                <br>an increase in bush fires, and a significant
                <br>of rainfall that has caused floods unluck any
                <br> other.
                <br>
                <br>The cause of these extreme conditions is largely
                <br>due to increase of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere
                <br>the main culprit being carbon dioxide (CO2). 
                 

            </p>
            <h2>Our Worlds Largest Culprits</h2>
            <p>Of course not all countries in our world are 
                <br>equally to blame. The Map below displays the
                <br>countries contributions this problem as of 2016.

            <h2>World Temperature and CO2 Emissions Comparison</h2>
            <p>The data displayed below compares the average Temperature (Celsius) 
                <br> to CO2 Emissions (Tonnes) from 1900 until 2013, to provide insight to 
                <br> the correlation between between these issues, to help combat 
                <br> rising global temperatures and climate change.

            <h2>Energy Mix of the World</h2>
            <p>So which energy sources make up the worlds energy?
                <br>As of 2019 most of our worlds energy is produced
                <br>from energy sources that emit CO2 into our atmosphere.
